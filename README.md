# Employee Tracker

<a name="description"></a>

## Description
The purpose of this program was to create a tool where a user or administrator could easily view, add, and update departments, roles, and employees for their company. The user will execute all functions with a command-line interface with node.js that delivers a series of prompts to implement and track information regarding employees. Along with adding employees, the user is able to add roles, salaries, and assign managers to those employees.
